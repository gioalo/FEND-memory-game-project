# Memory Game Project

The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once
all cards have successfully been matched.

## Resources

- CSS animations shoutouts to [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) Thank you awesome project!

## Dependencies

## TODOs
- Add CSS animations when cards are clicked, unsuccessfully matched, and
successfully matched.
- Add unique functionality beyond the minimum requirements (Implement a
leaderboard, store game state using local storage, etc.)
- Implement additional optimizations that improve the performance and user
experience of the game (keyboard shortcuts for gameplay, etc).
